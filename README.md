# Regex Project: Learning and Mastery

Welcome to my regex project! This repository is a space for me to explore, experiment, and document my journey learning regular expressions (regex) in Python (and eventually JavaScript).

## Project Goals
- **Learn** the basics and advanced concepts of regex.
- **Implement** real-world text processing tasks.
- **Experiment** with Python's `re` module and later transition to JavaScript.
- **Document** everything to make the project reproducible and insightful for others.

## Current Progress
- Followed a Python regex tutorial.
- Explored raw strings (`r''`) for escaping special characters.
- Practiced searching for patterns using Python's `re` module.

## Getting Started
To run the scripts and experiments in this repository:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Malek-Dinari/regeXperiment
   cd regeXperiment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start experimenting with the provided scripts or create your own.

## Structure
- **`README.md`**: This file, documenting the project.
- **`.gitignore`**: Contains files/folders to be ignored by Git.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies.
- **`regex-helper.txt`**: reg expressions helper. Learn at your own pace!
- **`regexcapade1.py`**: re python scripts where I practice regex with python. So far: 1. raw strings.
- **`regexcapade2.py`**: py script 2. finding pattern(s) in text.

## How to Contribute
Suggestions are always welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue if you have ideas to improve this regex project.
